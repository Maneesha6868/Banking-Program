# Java Banking Application
This project is a simple yet functional banking system developed in Java, designed to simulate basic banking operations through a console-based interface. The application allows users to:
- Check account balance
- Deposit funds
- Withdraw money
- Exit the application safely
  
Built during a holiday break as a personal learning endeavor, this project demonstrates foundational concepts in Java such as conditional statements, loops, methods, and user input handling via the Scanner class. It also reflects a strong understanding of control flow and basic data management. Beyond the technical skills, this project was a hands-on opportunity to practice problem-solving and logical thinking in a real-world context.
